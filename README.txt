INTRODUCTION
------------

This module provides a field formatter for File and Link fields which renders
the referenced file using Swagger UI if the file is a valid Swagger file.
Supported file types are JSON (.json) and/or YAML (.yml or .yaml). This module
uses the Swagger UI library available at
https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following outside of Drupal core.

For version 8.x-2.x the Swagger UI library needs to be installed separately.
Download the appropriate Swagger UI version, extract the archive and rename the
folder to "swagger-ui" or to "swagger_ui". Place the renamed folder in the
[DRUPAL ROOT]/libraries directory so its path will be
[DRUPAL ROOT]/libraries/swagger-ui for example.

 * Swagger UI - https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/
 * Swagger UI library - https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases
